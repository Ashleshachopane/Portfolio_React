📖 About the Project

This is my personal portfolio website built using React.js.
It showcases my skills, education, and projects in an interactive and visually appealing way.
The design focuses on a modern UI, smooth animations, and a responsive layout that works across all devices.

⚙️ Technologies Used

React.js – Frontend framework

Vite – Build tool for fast development

Tailwind CSS – For styling and responsive design

React Router DOM – For navigation

Typed.js / Framer Motion – For animations and typing effects

Git & GitHub – Version control and repository hosting

🚀 Development & Deployment Process

Project Setup:
Initialized a React project using Vite and configured dependencies.

Design & Layout:
Created a clean dark-themed design with smooth transitions and an animated hero section.

Component Structure:
Divided sections into reusable React components — Home, About, Education, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

Styling:
Implemented Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive design.

Deployment:
Deployed the project using Vercel (or Netlify, if applicable) directly from the GitHub repository.

🧩 Challenges Faced & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Issue integrating Typed.js with React	Installed using npm and initialized inside useEffect() to ensure proper DOM rendering.
Responsive design on smaller screens	Used Tailwind’s responsive utility classes to optimize layouts.
Smooth navigation between sections	Implemented react-scroll for smooth scrolling and section linking.
Dark/Light mode toggle not working initially	Fixed by managing theme state and syncing with Tailwind configuration.
